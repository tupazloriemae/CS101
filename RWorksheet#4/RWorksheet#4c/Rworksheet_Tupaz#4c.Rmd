# 2.b
# This plot might not be very useful if there are many models and manufacturers, as the points will likely overlap, making it hard to read. You could improve the visualization by:
#Using geom_jitter() to spread the points slightly and reduce overlap.
#Filtering the data to show only the most common manufacturers or models.
#Adding more informative aesthetics, such as color or size, based on another variable like displ or hwy from the mpg dataset.
