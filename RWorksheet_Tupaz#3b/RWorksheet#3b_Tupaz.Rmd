#The graph illustrates the sentiments expressed in tweets: negative sentiments are represented in red, neutral in orange, and positive in blue. On certain days, such as July 15 and 21, there were a significant number of negative tweets, while other days showed a prevalence of positive or neutral sentiments. This indicates that peopleâ€™s opinions were varied and shifted in response to events occurring that week, reflecting their tweets.
